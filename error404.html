<p id="bold">Most Terrible Day Of My Life...</p>
<br>
<p id="cont">
Once upon a time..., Okay leave that joke but seriuosly, one day I was given a project for summer holidays, I was working on that. I was already busy on that project for like last 5-6 days, and that day was also nothing different and special to me. Month of June had just begun and I was surfing web for some content to write in my project on different types of ships; their uses, size, power and all that random stuff, you know! But that day as soon as I opened a page for information, it showed "Error 404: The page you requested for is not found." I was like, whaaat!?!?!?(since I used that page several times before and it never acted this way.) But okay! I decided to head to another page. So I exit that and opened another, and bruh same: "Error 404: The page you requested for is not found." I thought internet is now playing with me! I went to another and boom! Same! I doubted! I search other things and tryna opening other pages, and to my utter surprise, ALL OF THEM, LIKE LITERALLY ALL OF THEM WERE OFF, SHOWING THE SAME, "Error 404: The page you requested for is not found." I thought, is the network disconnected today?!? That was terrifying, I was already alone at home. Mom, Dad were out for marketing. I tried many but all were shutdown until one page occured. A single page was open and actually worked, like a drop of water in hot, barren desert. But that page freaked me out. IT WAS CURSED FOR SOME REASON. It had weird, glitchy elements, eerie noises and unusual photos, like a darkweb page somehow surfaced. I was terrified and closed that, tried other pages but still Error 404, I again moved to that page and saw subtle changes. It was like someone just made it worse. I hit F5 to check whether it reverts to normal, but it went more creepy and disturbing after subtle more changes. I hit F5 again and again and the page was gradually growing more bizzare and disturbing. After 7-8 refreshes, I realised I could'nt handle it getting more worse. But still, with one eye closed and fingers crossed, I began spamming F5 again and again, and it just went too far until suddenly my pc crashed and suddenly shutdown! I screamed with terror. I just sat there looking at that desktop for like 30 minutes in shock. Maybe, I opened portal to another dimension. Maybe a pesky hacker was playing a prank on me. I tried calling my parents and what I listened nearly took my life out of me. "The number you are dialing is currently....*glitching* Error 404, Error 404, Error 404, Error 404..." I hung up. I just sat on my bed, covered myself with blanket. I was blank, I didn't knew what to do. This was something terrifying, I have never experienced it ever before. 3 hours passed by, I heard knocking on door. I went briskly and from peephole I saw my parents. I opened door and felt relieved. I didn't told them a word, but I went to my room back. Somehow, I gathered courage to open my desktop again. Tried some random search on browser and clicked the top search result... It OPENED. I felt relieved, but to reassure, I went to several other pages, they all worked normal. As if nothing happened. Now for real check. I visited that page again which freaked me out earlier. And instead of all those cursed elements, it showed "Error 404: The page you requested for is not found."
